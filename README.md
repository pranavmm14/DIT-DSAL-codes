# Data Structures and Algorithms Lab Codes

Welcome to my GitHub repository for Data Structures and Algorithms lab codes! My name is Pranav Mehendale, and I am a computer engineering student at Dr. D. Y. Patil Institute of Technology, Pimpri, which is affiliated to Savitribai Phule Pune University.

The codes in this repository are based on the SPPU syllabus of 2019 pattern and cover most of the practicals taught in our college.

## Lab Assignments

In this repository, you'll find codes for a variety of lab assignments, including:

1) Consider telephone book database of N clients. Make use of a hash table implementation 
    to quicklylook up client‘s telephone number.<br/>

2) Implement all the functions of a dictionary (ADT) using hashing.<br/>
    Data: Set of (key, value) pairs, Keys are mapped to values, Keys must be comparable, Keys 
        must be unique.<br/>
    Standard Operations: Insert (key, value), Find(key), Delete(key)<br/>

3) A book consists of chapters, chapters consist of sections and sections consist of subsections.
    Construct a tree and print the nodes. Find the time and space requirements of your method.<br/>

4) Beginning with an empty binary search tree, Construct binary searchtree by inserting the values
    in the order given. After constructing a binary tree –<br/>
    i. Insert new node<br/>
    ii. Find number of nodes in longest path<br/>
    iii. Minimum data value found in the tree<br/>
    iv. Change a tree so that the roles of the left and right pointers are swapped atevery node<br/>
    v. Search a value<br/>

5) Convert given binary tree into threaded binary tree. Analyze time and space complexity of the
    algorithm.<br/>

6) There are flight paths between cities. If there is a flight between city A and city B then
    there is an edge between the cities. The cost of the edge can be the time that flight take to
    reach city B from A, or the amount of fuel used for the journey. Represent this as a graph. The 
    node can be represented by airport name or name of the city. Use adjacency list representation of 
    the graph or use adjacency matrix representation of the graph. Justify the storage representation 
    used.

## Purpose of this Repository

I created this repository to serve as a valuable resource and reference for anyone studying Data Structures and Algorithms. Whether you're a student like me or a professional looking to refresh your knowledge, these codes will provide a solid foundation in the fundamentals of data structures and algorithms.
