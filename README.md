Hey There!<br/> 
     In this repository I am planning to upload all Data Structure And Algorithm lab codes for 
most of the practicals covered in my college Dr. D. Y. Patil Institute of Technology, Pimpri. 
College is affiliated to Savitribai Phule Pune University and the codes will be according to 
the SPPU syllabus of 2019 patt.<br/>
    I plan to create this repository in such a way that it will act as a good resource and 
refrence in future. Following are the titles of Lab Assignments for quick reference:<br/>

1) Consider telephone book database of N clients. Make use of a hash table implementation 
    to quicklylook up client‘s telephone number.<br/>

2) Implement all the functions of a dictionary (ADT) using hashing.<br/>
    Data: Set of (key, value) pairs, Keys are mapped to values, Keys must be comparable, Keys 
        must be unique.<br/>
    Standard Operations: Insert (key, value), Find(key), Delete(key)<br/>

3) A book consists of chapters, chapters consist of sections and sections consist of subsections.
    Construct a tree and print the nodes. Find the time and space requirements of your method.<br/>

4) Beginning with an empty binary search tree, Construct binary searchtree by inserting the values
    in the order given. After constructing a binary tree –<br/>
    i. Insert new node<br/>
    ii. Find number of nodes in longest path<br/>
    iii. Minimum data value found in the tree<br/>
    iv. Change a tree so that the roles of the left and right pointers are swapped atevery node<br/>
    v. Search a value<br/>

5) Convert given binary tree into threaded binary tree. Analyze time and space complexity of the
    algorithm.<br/>

6) There are flight paths between cities. If there is a flight between city A and city B then
    there is an edge between the cities. The cost of the edge can be the time that flight take to
    reach city B from A, or the amount of fuel used for the journey. Represent this as a graph. The 
    node can be represented by airport name or name of the city. Use adjacency list representation of 
    the graph or use adjacency matrix representation of the graph. Justify the storage representation 
    used.
